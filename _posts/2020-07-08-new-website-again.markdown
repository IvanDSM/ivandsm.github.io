Ok, I promise to myself this is the last time I change hosts for my website. I hope.
<!--more-->
I've worked with a really wide variety of hosts throughout the times I've tried to have a website. I first started out with Webs and I kept using for it years (still have it registered!), then not too long ago I decided to move to 000webhost as I wanted to try to write my own blog engine in PHP. That obviously didn't work out too well. So here we are! GitHub Pages! I wonder why I never thought of trying this before.

A friend of mine told me about Jekyll and how cool and wonderful it was and after about one hour I was able to migrate my website's (old, unfortunately) design over to it! Obviously there's still quite a bit of tweaking to be done but that's ok. What matters is I can actually update it without having to spend a huge amount of time just getting stuff ready to be able to update it.

So here's to a new journey, on my new old website, on a new platform! I hope this time it works out and I'm able to actually maintain a website! :)
